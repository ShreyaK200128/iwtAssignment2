            <h2> Introduction </h2>
		<p class="p1"><i>A network is a group of connected, communicating devices such as computers and printers.
			  An<b> internet(note the lowercase)</b> is two or more networks that can communicate with each other. </i>
			  The most notable internet is aclled the intercomposed of hundred of thousands of interconnected networks.
            </p>
			<p class="p2">Physically, the <b>Internet</b> uses a portion of the total resources of the currently existing public telecommunication networks. Technically, what distinguishes the Internet is its use of a set of protocols called Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Two recent adaptations of Internet technology, the Intranet and the extranet, also make use of the TCP/IP protocol.
				The Internet can be seen as having two major components: network protocols and hardware. The protocols, such as the TCP/IP suite, present sets of rules that devices must follow in order to complete tasks. Without this common collection of rules, machines would not be able to communicate.
				The protocols are also responsible for translating the alphabetic text of a message into electronic signals that can be transmitted over the Internet, and then back again into legible, alphabetic text.</p>
